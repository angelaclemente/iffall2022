        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>

        <ol>
        <li>Angela Clemente, Math and Comm Des double major, senior.</li>
        <li>Honestly I'm taking this class because it is required for my major.</li>
        <li>My only experience is from taking CSE131, so it is not my first time working with html. However that was a while ago and definently need a refresher.</li>
        <li>I hope to gain more familiarity with websites in a way that is related and useful to design. </li>
        <li>Designing for a screen has an entirely different set of variables than for paper, as mentioned in class there is no control over screen size when a site is viewed. </li>
        <li>Effective design:
            <a>https://www.nike.com</a>
            I think the nike website has effective design because it is appealing to look at accross different screens. While the site looks different on my phone compared to on my laptop, it maintains the nike aesthetic and useability. 
        </li>
        <li>Effective communication:
            <a>https://www.nytimes.com</a>
            Why: I think the New York Times has really effective communication. Some of the text is a bit dense for my liking, but it is still readable. It also effectively communicates headline and other important information, there is a very clear heirarchy. </li>
        </li>
        <li>Works well: 
            <a>https://www.amazon.com</a>
            Why: I think the Amazon website works well because it is easy to use. It effectively advertises products related to a search and makes purchasing things easy.
