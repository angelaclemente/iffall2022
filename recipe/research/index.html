        <h2>Sugar Cookie Recipe</h2>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a sugar cookie recipe from Food Network, courtesy of Alton Brown</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
            <li>powdered sugar,  for rolling out dough</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. Place butter and sugar in large bowl of electric stand mixer and beat until light in color. Add egg and milk and beat to combine. Put mixer on low speed, gradually add flour, and beat until mixture pulls away from the side of the bowl. Divide the dough in half, wrap in waxed paper, and refrigerate for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle surface where you will roll out dough with powdered sugar. Remove 1 wrapped pack of dough from refrigerator at a time, sprinkle rolling pin with powdered sugar, and roll out dough to 1/4-inch thick. Move the dough around and check underneath frequently to make sure it is not sticking. If dough has warmed during rolling, place cold cookie sheet on top for 10 minutes to chill. Cut into desired shape, place at least 1-inch apart on greased baking sheet, parchment, or silicone baking mat, and bake for 7 to 9 minutes or until cookies are just beginning to turn brown around the edges, rotating cookie sheet halfway through baking time. Let sit on baking sheet for 2 minutes after removal from oven and then move to complete cooling on wire rack. Serve as is or ice as desired. Store in airtight container for up to 1 week.</li>
        </ul>

    <p> I like how the Food Network website streamlines the recipe. I've found that a lot of recipe websites tend to hide the recipe and instructions in a lengthy personal story, which is not what I want when looking for a website. This site also includes a video tutorial which is nice. A criticism I have is that the instructions are too condensed. Regardless of content, the blocks of text are too dense to read at a glance.</p>

    <p>I like the images used in this recipe, though there are too many for my liking. The main reason I picked this recipe is that there is a "jump to recipe" option, so a user can quickly access the recipe and instructions.</p>

    <p>What drew me to this recipe is the step by step photographs that accompany the recipe. However, I realized that the pictures don't match the text / step of the recipe which I think takes away completely from the purpose of the images.</p>

    <h2>Website References</h2>
    <a href="https://thedieline.com/?">www.thedieline.com</a>
    <p> The Dieline is an incredibly compelling website. The font choice is so different from that of other websites, which makes it interesting. The composition of each image is thoughtful, and I find myself wanting to see more of the website. </p>
    <a href="https://baggu.com/">www.baggu.com</a>
    <p>I like this website because the products do the talking. Almost all the color on the site comes from its images. I also enjoy how at the bottom of the page is the brand name that spans across the bottom.</p>
    <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/">www.newyorker.com</a>
    <p>The New Yorker's website is really plesant to look at. The heirarchy of the text is very clear. I also appreciate the combination of typefaces, the headings, secondary type, and bylines are all very different, but they work together. </p>
