            <br>
            <br>
            <p>You don't mean to be a problem</p>
            <p>You don't mean to 'cause me pain</p>
            <p>You don't mean to do much but they're, one and the same</p>
            <p>I don't know where this came from</p>
            <p>I thought we were plain sailing</p>
            <p>This has taken me aback and it, it goes without saying</p>
            <br>
            <p>That I'm gonna feel broken for a bit</p>
            <p>Life's gonna be a little bit shit</p>
            <p>Oh, for at least the next week</p>
            <p>We had our flaws I'll be the first to admit</p>
            <p>And we both struggled to commit</p>
            <p>Oh, was it really that bleak?</p>
            <br>
            <p>And I don't know why I've been crying over you</p>
            <p>For the life of me, I wish that I knew</p>
            <p>And I don't know, just how much more I can go through</p>
            <p>Man, oh man I wish I knew, why I've been crying over you</p>
            <br>
            <p>I don't mean to be a problem</p>
            <p>I don't mean to 'cause you pain</p>
            <p>Don't wanna break it up but, there's no other way</p>
            <p>You're not the only one who's hurting</p>
            <p>Or who's finding this hard</p>
            <p>But you gotta admit that we're drifting apart</p>
            <br>
            <p>Look we're gonna feel broken for a bit</p>
            <p>And it's gonna be a little bit shit</p>
            <p>But you'll find the strength when you're weak</p>
            <p>You'll find a love when you least expect it</p>
            <p>It could be any minute</p>
            <p>So don't fight the tears on your cheek</p>
            <br>
            <p>And I don't know why I've been crying over you</p>
            <p>For the life of me, I wish that I knew</p>
            <p>And I don't know, just how much more I can go through</p>
            <p>Man oh man I wish I knew, why I've been crying over you</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now I don't like a cliché</p>
            <p>But I'm reading from the same book all over again</p>
            <p>All different covers, all different colors</p>
            <p>They're never the same</p>
            <p>But they always make me cry at the end</p>
            <p>We thought we gave each other a whole world</p>
            <p>But it turns out we that didn't know such a thing</p>
            <p>Guess life's like this, shit happens</p>
            <p>And we look for the magic</p>
            <p>But good things always come to an end, an end</p>
            <p>Ya know?</p>
            <br>
            <p>And I don't know (I don't know) why I've been crying over you (Over you)</p>
            <p>For the life of me, I wish that I knew</p>
            <p>And I don't know (Oh, I don't know), just how much more I can go through</p>
            <p>Man, oh man I wish I knew, why I've been crying over you</p>
            <br>
            <p>Man, oh man I wish I knew, why I've been crying over you</p>
            <p>Man, oh man I wish I knew, why I've been crying over you</p>
            <p>Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh</p>
            <p>Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh</p>
            <p>Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh</p>
            <p>Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh</p>
